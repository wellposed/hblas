synopsis:            Human friendly BLAS and Lapack bindings for Haskell.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    User friendly, simple bindings to BLAS and Lapack. Easy to extend and use.
    .
    HBLAS assumes you have BLAS and LAPACK installed. Users on OSX already
    have a BLAS and LAPACK installed for them. Users on LINUX and similar
    platforms will need to do the system equivalent of @sudo apt-get install libblas liblapack@.
    .
    HBLAS  is not intended to be a library for end user array operations,
    but rather an easy adaptor for calling BLAS and LAPACK routines in their
    full generality from your end-user haskell linear algebra / array library
    of choice.
    .
    HBLAS roughly mirrors the naming conventions and datatype names of  the standard
    BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Those of you who are familiar with these conventions
    and moderately comfortable with haskell will feel right at home.
    .
    If you are not familiar with the the operations and conventions of BLAS and
    Lapack, please read the
    <https://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/mkl/mklman/index.htm Intel MKL BLAS and LAPACK documention>,
    you'll learn a lot about what BLAS and LAPACK can do.
    .
    HBLAS doesn't provide every BLAS and LAPACK operation currently, but
    is designed so that adding support for new operations is quite easy!
